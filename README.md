Challenge #5

Write a Fibonacci number generator that outputs the numbers in the series that are less than 500.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence:
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,

 Often, especially in modern usage, the sequence is extended by one more initial term:

1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,



By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

 F_{n} = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2},\!\,} F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}

with seed values

 F_{1} = 1,\;F_{2}=1} F_{1}=1,\;F_{2}=1

or

 F_{0 = 0,\;F_{1}=1.} F_{0}=0,\;F_{1}=1.
